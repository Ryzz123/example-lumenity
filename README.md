### Installation

To install Lumenity Framework, you need to have PHP 8.2 or higher installed on your system. You also need to have Composer installed
on your system. You can install Composer by following the instructions on the Composer website.

Once you have Composer installed, you can install Lumenity Framework by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer create-project lumenity/framework
```

This will create a new directory called `Lumenity` in your current working directory and install Lumenity Framework in that directory.

### Configuration

Once you have installed Lumenity Framework, you need to configure it to work with your web server and database. You can do this by
editing the `.env` file in the `app` directory. You can configure the database connection settings, the base URL of your
web application, and other settings in this file.

### Usage

To use Lumenity Framework, you need to create a new controller class in the `app/http/Controllers` directory. You can create a new
controller class by extending the `Lumenity\Http\Controller` class and adding your own methods to the class.

You can then create a new route in the `routes/website.php` file that maps a URL to a controller method. You can do this by calling
the `get` or `post` method on the `$router` object and passing the URL and the controller method as arguments.

You can then run your web application by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

`package.json` run `npm run start` to start the server.

This will start a web server on `http://localhost:8000` that serves your web application.
